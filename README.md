# Heart_Disease_Prediction
<--Problem statement-->
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States.
One person dies every 37 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease.
For this project I will consider whether a person is diagnosed with a heart disease or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).

# Data
The Dataset for heart disease prediction is available at UCI machine learning repository.
The patients data is combined from various parts of the world including Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach.

# Results
The classification models used are Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Networks.
Best accuarcy is provided by logistic regression and neural networks around 87%
